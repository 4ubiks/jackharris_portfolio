# Portfolio Website
This is a React app built with Node.js. During my sophomore year of college, as an exploratory project, I built a portfolio website. It was a lot of fun, and I was able to learn a lot. However, it was nothing more than a clear first attempt. 

After spending some more time studying strong UI/UX design, organization, and general coding practices, I decided to revamp the website and put a new spin on it. 

It is still a React/Node.JS app built with NPM, that component has not changed. Necessary packages are listed below:
- `react-markdown`
- `remark-breaks`
- `react-router-dom`
  
The app runs with `npm start` when inside the parent directory `jackharris_portfolio`. 

## Terminal
One cool feature I decided to add to my new portfolio was a Linux-inspired terminal. Not implying the architecture of the website is at all related to the Linux kernel, but the commands used and style of the terminal would mirror Linux. Below are the commands:

`help` - displays all commands
`cat ____` - prints out a given file, if it exists
`ls` - lists contents (resume, blog, portfolio, etc)
`clear` - clears screen
`ret` - returns to normal view
`curl _____` - just opens a web page to whatever curled


And below are the files that 'exist':
`resume.md`
`portfolio.md`
`blog.md`
`linkedin.url`
`github.url`
`spotify.url`
