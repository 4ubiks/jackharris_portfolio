# Portfolio Website
This is a React app built with Node.js. During my sophomore year of college, as an exploratory project, I built a portfolio website. It was a lot of fun, and I was able to learn a lot. However, it was nothing more than a clear first attempt. 

After spending some more time studying strong UI/UX design, organization, and general coding practices, I decided to revamp the website and put a new spin on it. 

It is still a React/Node.JS app built with NPM, that component has not changed. Necessary packages are listed below:
- `react-markdown`
- `remark-breaks`
- `react-router-dom`
  
The app runs with `npm start` when inside the parent directory `jackharris_portfolio`.
